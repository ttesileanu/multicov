Some features of some of the functions included with MultiCOV cannot be
properly tested within the framework of unit tests. This is mostly the case
for interactive features such as progress indicators or the generation of
figures. In addition, although in principle testable, the unit tests generally
do not check that proper error messages are reported (nor, to be fair, are
these explicitly mentioned in the documentation, so their behavior should
in general not be considered certain).

For these cases, it is important to perform manual tests to check that the
behavior is correct. Here is a list of the most important functions and
features that should be tested.
